A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a Site(s)/ App(s) or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.

       </p> 
       
       <h2>COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES </h2>

A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site(s)/ App(s). A “Flash Cookie” is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-into or downloaded by you to your Device. Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your Device, some features of the Site(s)/ App(s) may not function properly. The use of cookies on the Site(s)/ App(s) allows you to enjoy more seamless visits and more accurately measures your behaviour on the Site(s)/ App(s).

They merely recognize your browser, unless you choose to identify yourself voluntarily. You may choose to identify yourself for any one of the following reasons: by asking the browser to remember your username and password, by responding to a promotional offer, or by personalizing a web page or requesting more information on a product or service.</p> 
        
       <p>Web beacons (also known as clear gifs) are used in combination with cookies to help Site(s)/ App(s) operators understand how you interact with their Site(s)/ App(s). A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1-pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a Site(s)/ App(s) or in an email.

       <p>Provide general internal and customer analytics.

If Google Analytics is used, the information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site(s)/ App(s) (including the IP address) will be transferred to and stored on a server of Google in the US. Google will use such information to analyze your use of the Site(s)/ App(s), to create reports about the Site(s)/ App(s) activities for IICS and to provide further services associated with the use of the Site(s)/ App(s) and the internet. Furthermore, Google may transfer such information to third parties, to the extent legally required or if such third parties process the data on behalf of Google.

If you are a Minor, and you wish to provide us with your Personal Information for any other purposes, such as to participate in a promotion or contest, you must read this Privacy Policy with your parent or guardian and must not provide your Personal Information without obtaining your parent’s or guardian’s prior consent and under their supervision.

       <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION SITE(S)/ APP(S) INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE PUBLICLY ON OUR SITE(S)/ APP(S)</h2> 
       <p>Our Site(s)/ App(s) may offer message boards, chat rooms, and other public areas (collectively, “Community Forums”) where you can engage in social networking, interact with others, as well as have the opportunity to submit photographs, writings, music, video, audio recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, including Personal Information (collectively, “User Submissions”). To participate in certain Community Forums, you may be asked to select a username, screen name or member name and password. Furthermore, any such User Submissions that you publish on our Site(s)/ App(s) or submit for publication on our Site(s)/ App(s) may be available, via the internet, around the world, and we cannot prevent the use or misuse of such information by others. </p> 
       
       
       <h2>NOTE THAT ANYTHING YOU POST TO A COMMUNITY FORUM IS PUBLIC </h2>
       <p>User Submission(s) may be used or shared with any third parties. Information you choose to post or make available in the Community Forums may be viewed, collected and used by others and we shall have no control over the manner and mode of such use. If you choose to voluntarily disclose User Submissions, the protections of this Privacy Policy will not cover such disclosure of information. Think carefully before you post and take caution before disclosing any Personal Information. 
       Also, functionality on the Site(s)/ App(s) may permit interactions between the Site(s)/ App(s) and a third-party Site(s)/ App(s) or service, such as enabling you to “like” a product on our Site(s)/ App(s) or “share” content to other Site(s)/ App(s) or services. If you choose to “like” or “share” content on the Site(s)/ App(s) or to otherwise post information from or via the Site(s)/ App(s) to a third party’s Site(s)/ App(s), service, feature or application, etc. that information will become public and the third party may have access to information about you and your use of our Site(s)/ App(s). 
       User Submissions may be published online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed). We may also publish your name, voice, likeness and other Personal Information with your User Submissions, and IICS may use the content, or any portion of the content, for advertising, marketing, publicity, promotional or any other activities. For full terms and conditions regarding User Submissions you submit to the Site(s)/ App(s), please refer to our Terms of Use. 
       </p> 
       
       <h2>INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES </h2>
       <p>IICS may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you are on another Site(s)/ App(s) and you opt-in to receive information from IICS that Site(s)/ App(s) will forward to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. You may also choose to participate in a third-party application or feature on our Site(s)/ App(s) (such as linking the Site(s)/ App(s) with another Site(s)/ App(s) or interactive service) or on a third-party Site(s)/ App(s) or service (such as one of our applications or features on a third-party Site(s)/ App(s) or service) through which you allow us to collect (or the third-party to share) information about you, including Personal Information. When you choose to participate, you may be opting to link your activity on our Site(s)/ App(s) with that third-party Site(s)/ App(s) or service, which may then collect information about your visits to our Site(s)/ App(s) and may publish that activity as you request to your “profile” or similar feature with that third-party (such as if you choose to share content you find on one of our Site(s)/ App(s) with your “connections” on the third-party’s Site(s)/ App(s) or service). The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. However, the information collected and stored by the third-party remains subject to the third-party’s privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us or with other third parties, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third-party’s Site(s)/ App(s) or service. The third-party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third-party Site(s)/ App(s) or service give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third-party Site(s)/ App(s) or interactive service. 
       We may also supplement the information we collect about you through the Site(s)/ App(s) with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from these third parties with information we collect through the Site(s)/ App(s). In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise. </p>
